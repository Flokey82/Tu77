Using tu77 with SimH on the PiDP-11, running 2.11 BSD
*****************************************************

First, install the modified TQ driver in SimH as follows. It's a good idea to make a
backup copy of /opt/pidp11 before doing that, in case something goes wrong.

  cd 
  cd Tu77/simh/pdp11_magtape_driver
  chmod +x install
  ./install

Building a new version of SimH with install will take a while, especially on slower
Raspberry Pimodels. The new TQ driver adds realistic timing and generates a status
byte in /tmp/tu56status, which can be used by tu77.

If you want to go back to the original driver, type

  cd 
  cd tu77/simh/pdp11_magtape_driver
  chmod +x uninstall
  ./uninstall

You have to restart simh after installing the new driver. The easiest way to do this
is to restart your Raspberry Pi.

Also, don't forget to enable the TQ driver in your boot.ini, see
https://github.com/rricharz/pidp11-2.11bsd.git.
You have to restart 2.11 BSD after changing boot.ini.

Now you are ready to use the tu77 front panel with the PiDP-11. Just start the front
panel at any time. It does not matter whether this is done before or after SimH and
BSD are started. Boot to 2.11 BSD, and use commands like "tar cv filename" or
"tar xv filename" to see the tape in action. It is much more fun to use "tar" if you
can see the tape in action.
